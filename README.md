# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification  

##  Project Overview  
This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using **Scikit-learn** on the Iris dataset.  
The main objective is to understand how KNN works, experiment with different values of **K**, and evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization techniques.

##  Steps Performed  
1. Loaded the **Iris dataset** using scikit-learn  
2. **Normalized features** with `StandardScaler`  
3. Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets  
4. Trained KNN with different values of **K (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)**  
5. Evaluated the model using:  
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
6. Plotted **Accuracy vs K** curve  
7. Visualized **decision boundaries** (using first two features)

##  Results  
- Best accuracy achieved at **K = X** (replace X with your result)  
- Confusion matrix showed effective classification of the three Iris flower species  
- Decision boundary visualization clearly separated classes in 2D feature space
